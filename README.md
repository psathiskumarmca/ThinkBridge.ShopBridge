# ThinkBridge.ShopBridge
I have spent around 4 hours on this project. Did not implement any Unit test as time constraints.
I have used code first approach.After modified the connection string pls run the update-database command for create DB.
Make sure startup project will be ThinkBridge.ShopBridge.Admin.UI and ThinkBridge.ShopBridge.API. Use Multiple Startup project option from Solution -> Property.
Update the connection string in ThinkBridge.hopBridge.Admin.API project appsettings.json file and ThinkBridge.ShopBridge.DataAccess ShopBridgeDbContext.cs file.
